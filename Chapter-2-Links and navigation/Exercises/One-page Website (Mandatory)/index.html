                    <p class="review">WICKED unfolds with the pop and panache of an interactive storybook, its music, 
                        costumes, art direction, and production design crafting a rich theatrical experience.<b> - Valerie Kalfrin</b></p>
                    <p class="review">Featuring a pair of outstanding, Oscar-nominated performances from Cynthia Erivo and 
                        Ariana Grande, a fantastic supporting cast, and a marvelous creative team, this is an adaptation that hits all the 
                        right notes.<b> - Jeff Beck</b></p>
                    <p class="review">While green could symbolize envy, jealousy, and the unknown, Elphaba is 
                        unapologetically who she is, leaving me to exclaim, “I want to be seen in green.” Wickedly entertaining and thought-provoking.

                    <!-- Trivia facts -->
                    <p class="trivia">As well as extensive CGI environments, some practical sets were built. Director Jon M. Chu wanted the world 
                        of Oz to feel like a real place for the actors and actresses, rather than just a computer-generated background. 
                        This included planting 9 million tulips to serve as part of the landscape for Munchkinland, although for wider shots 
                        VFX was still used.</p>
                    <p class="trivia">The vocals for the ensemble parts were prerecorded by a number of Broadway performers including some alumni 
                        from Wicked on Broadway, as opposed to being sung live on set like the lead vocals were.</p>
                    <p class="trivia">The horse Fiyero rides in this film is Jack, the horse Jonathan Bailey rode in Bridgerton (2020). 
                        Bailey reportedly felt a connection to Jack when making that series, so he asked to ride Jack in this movie.</p>
